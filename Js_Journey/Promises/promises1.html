    <title>Js Promises</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p>JavaScript is single threaded and synchronous. This means that only one thing can happen at a time. If you have a long running task, it will block the execution of the code and the user will have to wait. This is where promises come in. A promise is an object that may produce a single value some time in the future: either a resolved value, or a reason that itâ€™s not resolved (e.g., a network error occurred). A promise may be in one of 3 possible states: fulfilled, rejected, or pending. Promise users can attach callbacks to handle the fulfilled value or the reason for rejection.</p>
    <p>Promise is an object that represents the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. A promise is in one of these states:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>pending: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.</li>
        <li>fulfilled: meaning that the operation was completed successfully.</li>
        <li>rejected: meaning that the operation failed.</li>
    </ul>

    </p>
    <p>
        A promise is a returned object to which you attach callbacks, instead of passing callbacks into a function.
        with help of promises js can perform asynchronous operations. such network requests, file reading, etc. without having to wait for the operation to complete.
        js can perform long network requests without blocking the main thread.
        js can perform multiple network requests in parallel.

    </p>
    <h5>
        then(callback) function is used to handle the fulfilled value of the promise. It takes two arguments: callback functions for the success and failure cases of the Promise.
        catch(callback) function is used to handle the rejected value of the promise. It takes only one argument: callback function for the failure case of the Promise.

        let car = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
           fuelTank = True;
           if (fuelTank) {
             resolve();
           } else {
             reject();
           }
        })  
        car.then(function() {
           document.write("Car has fuel and can be driven");
        }).catch(function() {
           document.write("Car has no fuel and cannot be driven");
        });
