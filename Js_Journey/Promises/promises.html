//Promises are used to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript. They are easy to manage when dealing with multiple asynchronous operations where callbacks can create callback hell leading to unmanageable code.
//A Promise has four states:
//Pending: Initial State, before the Promise succeeds or fails
//Fulfilled: Completed Promise
//Rejected: Failed Promise
//Settled: Promise that is either fulfilled or rejected
//A Promise is an object that may produce a single value some time in the future: either a resolved value, or a reason that itâ€™s not resolved (e.g., a network error occurred). A Promise may be in one of 3 possible states: fulfilled, rejected, or pending. Promise users can attach callbacks to handle the fulfilled value or the reason for rejection.
//A Promise is in one of these states:
